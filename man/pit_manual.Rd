\description{
Function to calculate tax liability using custom tax tables
}
\details{
\code{pit_manual} takes a vector of income and age and a matrix representation of the income tax brackets and
the rebate available per age to calculate the tax liability.
Allowing for custom tax tables make it easier to model policy changes.
Since it is implemented in C++ it should be relatively quick and well-suited to large datasets.

           tax-table = Tax_tables$PIT_brackets_2021, rebate_table = Tax_tables$PIT_rebates_2021)
